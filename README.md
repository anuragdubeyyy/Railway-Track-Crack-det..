# Railway-Track-Crack-det..
Project Description: This project aims to develop an automated system for detecting cracks and defects in railway tracks using a Raspberry Pi 4. The system uses computer vision techniques to analyze images captured by a camera mounted on a moving train or trackside camera, identifying cracks, deformations, or other potential issues. This system can be deployed for real-time monitoring of railway tracks, helping in maintenance and ensuring safety. Key Features: *Crack Detection: Detects visible cracks or deformations in the railway tracks. *Image Capture: Uses a Raspberry Pi Camera Module or external USB camera to capture track images. *Real-time Processing: Processes images using Python and OpenCV for immediate analysis. *Machine Learning: Optionally, a deep learning model (e.g., CNN) can be employed for more accurate crack detection. *Alert System: Sends notifications (email/SMS) upon detecting significant cracks or track deformations. *Edge Detection Algorithms: Uses image processing techniques like Canny edge detection to highlight track cracks. Hardware Requirements: *Raspberry Pi 4 (with Raspberry Pi OS installed) *Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 or USB camera *MicroSD Card (for Raspberry Pi OS and project code) *Power Supply (for Raspberry Pi and peripherals) *Optional: External storage or cloud service for storing images and logs Software Requirements: *Raspberry Pi OS (or another compatible Linux-based OS) *Python 3 *OpenCV (for image processing tasks) *TensorFlow or PyTorch (optional, for deep learning-based crack detection) *Email/SMS libraries (for sending alerts) Installation Guide: (1)Set Up Raspberry Pi:Install Raspberry Pi OS on a microSD card and boot the Raspberry Pi 4. Connect a Raspberry Pi Camera Module or USB camera to the Raspberry Pi. (2)Install Required Software: sudo apt update sudo apt install python3-opencv python3-picamera pip install tensorflow # if using deep learning (3)Clone Repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/railway-track-crack-detection.git cd railway-track-crack-detection (4)Run the Crack Detection Script: python3 detect_cracks.py (5)Set Up Alert System: To enable SMS or email alerts upon crack detection, configure the alert system in the alerts.py script with your preferred method (e.g., Twilio for SMS, SMTP for email).
